To deploy an HTML page using Apache, I first ensured Apache was installed and configured properly on my system. I created the HTML page and saved it, which is the default web root for Apache. Then, I adjusted the file permissions to ensure Apache could access and serve the file. After verifying the Apache service was running, I opened a browser and navigated to http://34.253.140.141/ to confirm that the page was live and accessible.
